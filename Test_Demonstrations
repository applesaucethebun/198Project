# Test Demonstrations

Here are our three selected test demonstrations, showcasing key functionalities of our system:

## 1. Test of UV Sensor with Low UV Rays
- **Description**: Demonstrates the UV sensor’s ability to detect low UV levels indoors.  
- **Test Inputs/Parameters**: Absence of UV light (no UV flashlight used).  
- **Pass/Fail Threshold**:  
  - **Pass**: OLED display shows a UV index under 3 and includes a "safe" icon.  
  - **Fail**: OLED display shows an incorrect UV index or indicates it is unsafe.

## 2. Test of Communication Between STM32 Modules
- **Description**: Demonstrates data transmission between two STM32 modules, reflecting real-time UV index values.  
- **Test Inputs/Parameters**: UV sensor readings with varying intensities from a UV flashlight.  
- **Pass/Fail Threshold**:  
  - **Pass**: The OLED connected to the second STM32 reflects accurate UV index values corresponding to UV intensity changes.  
  - **Fail**: Data is not transmitted, or the OLED displays incorrect or inconsistent UV index values.

## 3. Test of OLED Brightness and Readability
- **Description**: Demonstrates the OLED display’s readability from side-to-side angles.  
- **Test Inputs/Parameters**: Simulated UV index readings displayed on the OLED.  
- **Pass/Fail Threshold**:  
  - **Pass**: OLED display remains readable from side-to-side angles up to 100 degrees.  
  - **Fail**: OLED display is not readable within the specified angle range.  

The demonstrations will be conducted in-person.
